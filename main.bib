  abstract	= {The design of complex Petri net models is a challenge with
		  respect to intuition, correctness and efficiency. In the
		  case that systems' models are of large scale and consist of
		  numerous nets, as in the case of Petri net-based software
		  engineering, net components - an implementation of a
		  pattern-based approach - are applied successfully. This
		  paper summarizes our efforts made and experiences with net
		  components. It illustrates the concept, design and usage of
		  net components. It additionally presents the experiences
		  gained from several software development projects over the
		  last few years.
		  
		  Net components are subnets that are combined with each
		  other to form a Petri net. By this component-based approach
		  of constructing Petri nets, the construction of nets is
		  facilitated as well as accelerated, and the Petri nets are
		  structured in an intuitive, easily readable and unified
		  way. To illustrate the presented concepts, some net
		  components that are frequently used in an agent-oriented
		  approach in the context of Mulan are introduced. Besides
		  the fact that they provide the basic functionality in
		  regard to the communication that is done by protocol nets,
		  also some simple patterns and programming artifacts are
		  introduced into the development process.},

  abstract = 	 {The PAOSE approach to software engineering combines Petri
                  nets with the paradigm of agent-orientation and utilises
                  the agent metaphor to structure large software systems
                  and their development.  Up until now the PAOSE approach
                  only exhibited aspects of verification in a rudimentary
                  way.  This is due to the complexity of the systems to be
                  verified on the one hand, and the expressiveness of the
                  employed Petri net formalism of reference nets on the
                  other hand.  This contribution deals with enhancing the
                  tool support for PAOSE in this regard.

                  We present how we technically integrate the functionality
                  of LoLA, a sophisticated verification tool, into Renew,
                  the development and runtime environment that backs PAOSE.
                  Furthermore we sketch how structural aspects of
                  multi-agent systems developed with the agent framework of
                  Mulan can be exploited for verification.  The results of
                  the integration are applied in the context of distributed
                  network security for the Herold research project.}

		  development of flexible architectures several approaches
		  are used, which often differ already on the conceptual
		  grounds. Two of these paradigms are characterized by the
		  strong underlying metaphors plug-ins and agents. Plug-ins
		  emphasize on an extension relation between pairs of
		  components where each component participates in a clearly
		  specified role. Agents have a wide variety of attributes,
		  such as mobility, autonomy, adaptability and
		  pro-activeness. The general relationship of agents is that
		  of peers mutually offering and using their services --
		  higher organizational abstractions have to be implemented
		  based on this service-oriented view.
		  
		  This paper proposes to conjoin both paradigms of
		  multi-agent systems and plug-in systems, leading to the
		  concept of a plug-in agent. First, we discuss
		  characteristics of both concepts. The discussion clearly
		  shows that agents and extensible components have structural
		  similarities. This follows the combination of both concepts
		  into the new concept of the plug-in agent.
		  
		  The approach presented in this paper is unique as it
		  handles both concepts on the same architectural level -- to
		  our knowledge, all other existing combinations of agents
		  and plug-ins use one of the concepts to model or implement
		  the other.}

                  concurrency. Petri nets are a well-established
                  means for the description of concurrent
                  systems. Reference nets are higher level,
                  object-oriented Petri nets. With Renew
                  (REference NEt Workshop), there exists a tool
                  to model and execute reference nets with
                  seamless Java integration. So, reference nets
                  can be used to design executable multi-agent
                  systems while hiding the sometimes annoying
                  details of concurrent implementations in
                  traditional programming languages. The
                  technique is currently used to implement a
                  FIPA-compliant agent platform for multi-agent
                  systems (called CAPA) focused on retaining a
                  maximum level of concurrency in the system.}
